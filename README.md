# Abstract
- The idea of developing a Correspondence Management System (CMS) was first inspired by discovering our university's HRM "Human Resources Management System".
- By questioning the head of the department, Dr. Mohammad Khalil, and some of our lecturers on how the communication process runs among these lecturers themselves, and among the lecturers and their heads of departments and deans for example, we concluded that the process of workflow communications and messaging inside our university is almost automated and pretty much comfortable.
- Hence, we began thinking of why not trying to adopt a new similar software system that offers the same essential functions and modules which the PTUK HRM system offers,
 but with an attempt to generalize the system by making it flexible to fit the needs of any organization, not only a university, since most of the establishments share a nearly similar workflow communication and messaging process, with some additional custom differences.

### 11. On request pagination
- Imagine the delay that is caused when the user views their inbox that contains more than 1000 records for example! 
- Emails should be fetched from the server only on-demand. Which means: Don‚Äôt fetch huge amount of data at once. Instead, fetch data in batches
